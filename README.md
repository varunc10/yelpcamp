YelpCamp
YelpCamp is a full-stack web application built using Node.js, Express, JavaScript, and MongoDB. The aim of this project is to create a platform for users to view and explore various campsites. Users can browse through a collection of campgrounds, view details and images of each campground, and leave ratings and reviews for their camping experiences. The application offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing authenticated users to add new campgrounds, edit existing campgrounds, and delete campgrounds. The website also incorporates user authentication and authorization features, enabling users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
